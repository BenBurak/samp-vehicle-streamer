# SA-MP Vehicle Streamer Plugin
This plugin was created for SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer). The purpose of the plugin is to exceed vehicle limits. Since it is coded in C ++, pawn payloads are avoided. This plugin is currently under construction.

## Documentation

There is currently no documentation for the plugin. A documentation will be prepared when the plugin is complete.
